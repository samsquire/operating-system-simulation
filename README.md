# operating-system-simulation

This is my attempt to explore alternative interfaces to computers.

I'm very much love the idea of web based desktops but I think computers need an alternative model of interaction to be useful.

This is similar in goal behind my other two projects:

* Cloudgame [samsquire/cloudgame](https://github.com/samsquire/cloud-game) [replit/@Chronological/cloud-game](https://replit.com/@Chronological/CloudGame)
* Movement programming [samsquire/movement-programming](https://github.com/samsquire/movement-programming)

This visualisation simulates processes that execute in parallel.

A simulation table of processes and states.

It has a parser for a ["statelines" syntax](https://github.com/samsquire/dream-programming-language#introducing-statelines)
